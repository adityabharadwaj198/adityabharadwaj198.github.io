# 👋 Hi, I'm Aditya

Software engineer, heavy lifter, technology enthusiast. Curious about startups, history, space, geopolitics, climate, energy, physics and math. 

## 🚀 About Me
Currently interested in vector stores, eval engines, and building my own toy systems. I loved space as a child and dreamt of being an astronaut (unironically). I hope to do space robotics one day. 

I spent ~4.25 years at Amazon building systems that power payment selection, payment processing and transaction history for India marketplace. Simplistically, if you've ever paid on Amazon, you have touched code that I wrote. I have spent almost ~0.75 years now at a early stage vector search engine company where we vectorise products using LLMs and store their vector embeddings in a vector store to enable search & recommendations usecases. 
When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new music, working out, reading history or geopolitics.
