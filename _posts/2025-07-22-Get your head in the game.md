Things I need to do to stay maximally productive (I forget these frequently)


I like being productive, it makes me not hate myself. dw I like having fun too, but I wanna feel like I've really exhausted myself being productive so that having fun really pays off. I don't like having fun if I've not worked enough. 

Things I need to do to stay maximally productive (I forget these frequently)

## Go to the gym 
Reasons to consider: 
1. The endorphin rush is real, mood is elevated, you start feeling good. This was so vague to me when I used to hear it from other people. During COVID WFH I worked out a lot and I'd always find myself being chirpier, singing songs, having fun & being talkative with friends & family if I met them right after the gym and that for me signals elevation of mood
2. Energy levels post workout are higher. Again goes back to being chirpier, being talkative & generally just thinking let's get this shit done 
3. I feel productive by doing it. Let's face it going to the gym is like any other task and if you do it you get to cut off a task from your todo list. 
4. It is absolutely the 1 thing in my life that I love
If not feeling like it, watch a workout video on the youtube: Omar Isuf / Jeff Nippard / Arnold / Saket Gokhale. These are some youtubers I like to watch. 

## Drink some coffee in the morning with / without protein 
Helps me stay awake in the afternoon. Huberman's golden rule is to drink after 90 minutes of waking up so try to stick to that 

## Keep phone away in another room. 
Another thing to add here is to turn on self control for ~12 hours. I think we all struggle with scrolling X, this is one way to avoid it. 

## If not getting motivation 
### 1. Watching Naval / anyone else you respect

### 2. Watch Striver for leetcode motivation. 

## Always make a to-do list for the day
Even if you miss tasks, considering you complete > 60% tasks, treat the day as a win. 
Another thing that I've found helpful is, to estimate the time required for a task & write it down on your todo list. If a task takes ~5 minutes, do it right away. Then do other tasks in ascending order of time required. 

## Set a pomodoro timer 
I usually set one for 30 minutes + 5 minutes break, and if I'm flowing, then I hit multiple sessions back to back. Always respect the timer and don't do anything else apart from productive work during this time. 

## Put on binaural 60 hz augmented gamma beats
or whatever the hell it's called. I've heard it helps with focus. I usually put it on, maybe placebo but helps.
