<h2 id="what-to-expect">What to Expect</h2>

<p>In this blog, I’ll be writing about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Personal projects and experiences</li>
  <li>My experiences with building my own X</li>
  <li>My experiences navigating the software engineering world</li>
  <li>Book / Album reviews and Songs / Artist recommendations</li>
  <li>History? Prehistoric India, IVC, Proto-Indo-Europeans [controversial stuff lol], Vedic age etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-i-started-this-blog">Why I Started This Blog</h2>

<p>I am lazy and I never thought of writing anything more than what the educational curriculum 
demanded from me, but I have recently started to journal sometimes just to feel saner. 
I can’t pin-point what it does for me, other than make me feel good in some way.
For all I know it could be placebo. Anywhoo, I keep reading &amp; learning a 
lot of interesting things, that might be of interest in general to the
rest of the world (trust me), and what better way to explain something 
than to write it down in your own words. So this is my attempt at writing.</p>

<p>Through the blog I want to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Document my learning journey</li>
  <li>Share insights that might help others</li>
  <li>Connect with like-minded individuals</li>
  <li>Build a portfolio of my thoughts and expertise</li>
  <li>Build my own corner of the internet :)</li>
</ol>
