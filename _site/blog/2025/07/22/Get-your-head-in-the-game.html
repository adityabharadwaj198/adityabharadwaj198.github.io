    <p>Things I need to do to stay maximally productive (I forget these frequently)</p>

<p>I like being productive, it makes me not hate myself. dw I like having fun too, but I wanna feel like I’ve really exhausted myself being productive so that having fun really pays off. I don’t like having fun if I’ve not worked enough.</p>

<p>Things I need to do to stay maximally productive (I forget these frequently)</p>

<h2 id="go-to-the-gym">Go to the gym</h2>
<p>Reasons to consider:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The endorphin rush is real, mood is elevated, you start feeling good. This was so vague to me when I used to hear it from other people. During COVID WFH I worked out a lot and I’d always find myself being chirpier, singing songs, having fun &amp; being talkative with friends &amp; family if I met them right after the gym and that for me signals elevation of mood</li>
  <li>Energy levels post workout are higher. Again goes back to being chirpier, being talkative &amp; generally just thinking let’s get this shit done</li>
  <li>I feel productive by doing it. Let’s face it going to the gym is like any other task and if you do it you get to cut off a task from your todo list.</li>
  <li>It is absolutely the 1 thing in my life that I love
If not feeling like it, watch a workout video on the youtube: Omar Isuf / Jeff Nippard / Arnold / Saket Gokhale. These are some youtubers I like to watch.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="drink-some-coffee-in-the-morning-with--without-protein">Drink some coffee in the morning with / without protein</h2>
<p>Helps me stay awake in the afternoon. Huberman’s golden rule is to drink after 90 minutes of waking up so try to stick to that</p>

<h2 id="keep-phone-away-in-another-room">Keep phone away in another room.</h2>
<p>Another thing to add here is to turn on self control for ~12 hours. I think we all struggle with scrolling X, this is one way to avoid it.</p>

<h2 id="if-not-getting-motivation">If not getting motivation</h2>
<h3 id="1-watching-naval--anyone-else-you-respect">1. Watching Naval / anyone else you respect</h3>

<h3 id="2-watch-striver-for-leetcode-motivation">2. Watch Striver for leetcode motivation.</h3>

<h2 id="always-make-a-to-do-list-for-the-day">Always make a to-do list for the day</h2>
<p>Even if you miss tasks, considering you complete &gt; 60% tasks, treat the day as a win. 
Another thing that I’ve found helpful is, to estimate the time required for a task &amp; write it down on your todo list. If a task takes ~5 minutes, do it right away. Then do other tasks in ascending order of time required.</p>

<h2 id="set-a-pomodoro-timer">Set a pomodoro timer</h2>
<p>I usually set one for 30 minutes + 5 minutes break, and if I’m flowing, then I hit multiple sessions back to back. Always respect the timer and don’t do anything else apart from productive work during this time.</p>

<h2 id="put-on-binaural-60-hz-augmented-gamma-beats">Put on binaural 60 hz augmented gamma beats</h2>
<p>or whatever the hell it’s called. I’ve heard it helps with focus. I usually put it on, maybe placebo but helps.</p>
