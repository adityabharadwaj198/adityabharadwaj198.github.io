excerpt: "A comprehensive mind map covering the foundational topics and key concepts in system design, from concurrency and scaling to caching and load balancing."

These are some (not so) rough notes that I made while recently going through a system design course. 
The mind map covers the 6 foundational topics of system design namely:
1. Database
2. Caching
3. Scaling 
4. Delegation
5. Communication
6. Concurrency

I used ChatGPT to make some cards more comprehensible but some cards still exist as a rough hand. The instructor took an example of a Medium like blogging website to demo so you may see it being mentioned in a few cards.
